Hello! My name is Kall and welcome to my github!

I'm a hobby programmer currently studying IT. I'm joining Github to have somewhere to share my projects and hopefully be able to move into more professional work eventually.

While I'm not planning to put all my work publicly, the projects that I finish after this githubs creation is probably ending up here eventually.

I have worked within alot of different avenunes of programming, from graphic, frontend, backend, server management etc, but im always open to working with pretty much everything
